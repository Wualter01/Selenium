           NOTES:

How do we handle dropdowns using Selenium?
HOW MANY TYPES OF DROPDOWN ARE THERE?
1- Select dropdowns: are created by using <select> tag in HTML
‹select>
<option value="1"› option1 </option> ‹option value="2"› option2 </option> <option value="3"› option3 </option>
< select>
-use select class to locate them.
2- HTML dropdowns: these are the dropdowns that are created NOT USING <select>
- These dropdowns are handled just like any other webElement you will see on the page.

Web tables
//table [@id='ct10o_MainContent_orderGrid']/tbody/tr
//table [@id-'ctlO0 _MainContent_orderGrid'J//tr -> is the same as above we dont pass tbody and instead pass //tr it
means the same thing


Java scrip uses when you cant do certain actions with selenium
for some actions that selenium wont be able to handle

  JavaScriptExecutor is an Interface that helps to execute JavaScript through Selenium Webdriver.
 JavaScriptExecutor provides two methods "executescript" & "executeAsyncScript" to run javascript on the
 selected window or current page.This method executes JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame
 or window in Selenium.

 JavaScriptExecutor:
 1- We create javascriptExecutor object and we cast our WebDriver type instance into JavascriptExecutor type
 JavascriptExecutor ]s = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
 2- Then we have access to the methods that are coming from JavascriptExecutor interface js.executeScript
 (Script, Arguments); For arguments scrollDown, click ,window.open etc..
 -- you will prefer to use when you are not able to do some actions with selenium

 The syntax of ScrollBy() methods is :

executeScript("window.scrollBy(x-pixels,y-pixels)");

it moves left if number is positive and
it move right if number is negative y-pixels is the number at y-axis,
it moves down if number is positive and it move to the up if number is in negative
